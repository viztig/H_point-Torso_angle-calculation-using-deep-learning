H-point or hip point is an expression used in interior design of automotive vehicles, which is a pivot
point between the torso and the upper leg of the body. This point is used to determine various design
considerations for other components in ergonomic design and seat comfort. In a physical setting, an SAE
model is placed on the seat and the H-point is measured but this approach needs a complete seat model. In
most cases, the designers need to know the H-point to design the other interior components, which is done
before the manufacturing of the seat and the physical testing is not possible.

A finite element analysis is performed on the CAD model of the seat where a SAE dummy of n-percentile
occupant is positioned on the seat to determine the H-point. This is a very time consuming process taking
more than fifteen hours for the whole simulation to run for a single seat model.
